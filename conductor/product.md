# Asset Catalog Viewer

## Initial Concept
A VS Code and Cursor extension that provides an Xcode-like interface for previewing and inspecting `.xcassets` (Asset Catalog) directories.

## Product Vision
To provide a seamless, high-fidelity, and lightweight asset management experience for Apple platform developers within VS Code and Cursor, eliminating the need to frequently switch to Xcode.

## Target Users
- **iOS/macOS Developers:** Primary users who develop for Apple platforms using VS Code or Cursor and need to inspect and manage asset catalogs.

## Core Goals
- **High-Fidelity Replication:** Faithfully replicate the visual experience of Xcode's asset catalog viewer.
- **Lightweight Alternative:** Provide a fast, responsive alternative to Xcode for quick asset inspection and management.
- **Integrated Management:** Enable common asset management tasks (adding, renaming, deleting) directly within the editor.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Asset Support:** High-fidelity previews for Image Sets, Color Sets, App Icon Sets, Data Sets, and Lottie animations.
- **Xcode-Inspired Interface:** A familiar three-panel layout mimicking the Xcode environment.
- **Interactive Asset Management:**
    - Rename and delete assets or folders.
    - Add new assets (Image Sets, Color Sets, etc.) via context menus.
- **Editor Integration:** Deep integration with VS Code's sidebar, command palette, and Finder/Quick Look features.

## User Experience (UX)
- **Instant Feedback:** Modifications to assets should be reflected immediately in the UI.
- **Seamless Workflow:** The extension should feel like a native part of the VS Code development environment.
