# Project Workflow

## Guiding Principles

1. **The Plan is the Source of Truth:** All work must be tracked in `plan.md`
2. **The Tech Stack is Deliberate:** Changes to the tech stack must be documented in `tech-stack.md` *before* implementation
3. **User Experience First:** Every decision should prioritize user experience
4. **Non-Interactive & CI-Aware:** Prefer non-interactive commands. Use `CI=true` for watch-mode tools (tests, linters) to ensure single execution.

## Task Workflow

All tasks follow a strict lifecycle:

### Standard Task Workflow

1. **Select Task:** Choose the next available task from `plan.md` in sequential order

2. **Mark In Progress:** Before beginning work, edit `plan.md` and change the task from `[ ]` to `[~]`

3. **Implementation:**
   - Follow the code style guides in `conductor/code_styleguides/`.
   - Implement the logic as specified in the task and `spec.md`.

4. **Document Deviations:** If implementation differs from tech stack:
   - **STOP** implementation
   - Update `tech-stack.md` with new design
   - Add dated note explaining the change
   - Resume implementation

5. **Commit Code Changes:**
   - Stage all code changes related to the task.
   - Propose a clear, concise commit message e.g, `feat(ui): Create basic HTML structure for calculator`.
   - Perform the commit.

6. **Attach Task Summary with Git Notes:**
   - **Step 6.1: Get Commit Hash:** Obtain the hash of the *just-completed commit* (`git log -1 --format="%H"`).
   - **Step 6.2: Draft Note Content:** Create a detailed summary for the completed task. This should include the task name, a summary of changes, a list of all created/modified files, and the core "why" for the change.
   - **Step 6.3: Attach Note:** Use the `git notes` command to attach the summary to the commit.
     ```bash
     # The note content from the previous step is passed via the -m flag.
     git notes add -m "<note content>" <commit_hash>
     ```

7. **Get and Record Task Commit SHA:**
    - **Step 7.1: Update Plan:** Read `plan.md`, find the line for the completed task, update its status from `[~]` to `[x]`, and append the first 7 characters of the *just-completed commit's* commit hash.
    - **Step 7.2: Write Plan:** Write the updated content back to `plan.md`.

8. **Commit Plan Update:**
    - **Action:** Stage the modified `plan.md` file.
    - **Action:** Commit this change with a descriptive message (e.g., `conductor(plan): Mark task 'Create user model' as complete`).

### Phase Completion Verification and Checkpointing Protocol

**Trigger:** This protocol is executed immediately after a task is completed that also concludes a phase in `plan.md`.

1.  **Announce Protocol Start:** Inform the user that the phase is complete and the verification and checkpointing protocol has begun.

2.  **Propose a Detailed, Actionable Manual Verification Plan:**
    -   **CRITICAL:** To generate the plan, first analyze `product.md`, `product-guidelines.md`, and `plan.md` to determine the user-facing goals of the completed phase.
    -   You **must** generate a step-by-step plan that walks the user through the verification process, including any necessary commands and specific, expected outcomes.
    -   The plan you present to the user **must** follow this format:

        **For a Change:**
        ```
        The changes have been implemented. For manual verification, please follow these steps:

        **Manual Verification Steps:**
        1.  **Action:** [Step-by-step instruction]
        2.  **Expected Result:** [What the user should see or experience]
        ```

3.  **Await Explicit User Feedback:**
    -   After presenting the detailed plan, ask the user for confirmation: "**Does this meet your expectations? Please confirm with yes or provide feedback on what needs to be changed.**"
    -   **PAUSE** and await the user's response. Do not proceed without an explicit yes or confirmation.

4.  **Create Checkpoint Commit:**
    -   Stage all changes. If no changes occurred in this step, proceed with an empty commit.
    -   Perform the commit with a clear and concise message (e.g., `conductor(checkpoint): Checkpoint end of Phase X`).

5.  **Attach Auditable Verification Report using Git Notes:**
    -   **Step 5.1: Draft Note Content:** Create a detailed verification report including the manual verification steps and the user's confirmation.
    -   **Step 5.2: Attach Note:** Use the `git notes` command and the full commit hash from the previous step to attach the full report to the checkpoint commit.

6.  **Get and Record Phase Checkpoint SHA:**
    -   **Step 6.1: Get Commit Hash:** Obtain the hash of the *just-created checkpoint commit* (`git log -1 --format="%H"`).
    -   **Step 6.2: Update Plan:** Read `plan.md`, find the heading for the completed phase, and append the first 7 characters of the commit hash in the format `[checkpoint: <sha>]`.
    -   **Step 6.3: Write Plan:** Write the updated content back to `plan.md`.

7. **Commit Plan Update:**
    - **Action:** Stage the modified `plan.md` file.
    - **Action:** Commit this change with a descriptive message following the format `conductor(plan): Mark phase '<PHASE NAME>' as complete`.

8.  **Announce Completion:** Inform the user that the phase is complete and the checkpoint has been created, with the detailed verification report attached as a git note.

### Quality Gates

Before marking any task complete, verify:

- [ ] Code follows project's code style guidelines (as defined in `code_styleguides/`)
- [ ] All public functions/methods are documented (e.g., docstrings, JSDoc, GoDoc)
- [ ] Type safety is enforced (e.g., type hints, TypeScript types, Go types)
- [ ] No linting or static analysis errors (using the project's configured tools)
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced

## Development Commands

### Setup
```bash
npm install
```

### Daily Development
```bash
npm run compile
npm run lint
npm run debug
```

### Before Committing
```bash
npm run lint
npm run compile
```

## Code Review Process

### Self-Review Checklist
Before requesting review:

## Commit Guidelines

### Message Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Examples
```bash
git commit -m "feat(ui): Add asset rename functionality"
git commit -m "fix(parser): Correctly handle nested folders in xcassets"
```

## Definition of Done

A task is complete when:

1. All code implemented to specification
2. Code passes all configured linting and static analysis checks
3. Implementation notes added to `plan.md`
4. Changes committed with proper message
5. Git note with task summary attached to the commit

## Emergency Procedures

### Critical Bug in Production
1. Create hotfix branch from main
2. Implement minimal fix
3. Test thoroughly
4. Deploy immediately
5. Document in plan.md

## Continuous Improvement

- Review workflow weekly
- Update based on pain points
- Document lessons learned
- Optimize for user happiness
- Keep things simple and maintainable
